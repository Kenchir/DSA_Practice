Intersection: Given two straight line segments (represented as a start point and an end point),
compute the point of intersection, if any.
i.e

line1 = (0,0) ,(10,10)
line2 = (10,0), (0,10)

When two lines meet that means the points for the two lines are equal

How to move along the two lines???
Maybe -
